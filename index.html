  <h1>What is a Black Hole?</h1>
<p >A black hole is an area in space in which matter is so dense that the gravitational force exerted by the matter is so high even light cannot escape. They are the the objects that have the most gravitational pull and they come in 2 forms, Spinning and non-spinning. Spinning black holes spin, these are usually many solar masses while non-spinning black holes can be 1 solar mass.</p>

    <p><h1>Formation Of Black Holes</h1></p>
    <p>The formation of black holes typically occur during a Kilonova (2 Neutron stars Collide) or a Supernova (implosion then explosion of a star). The matter in these objects heat up due to the increased thermal energy.</p>
    <p > After a point the protons and electrons cannot heat up any further and therefore fuse to become neutrons. If the matter does not heat up any further after this formation to neutrons then the star is called a neutron star. But if the matter does reach the limit for the energy carried by a neutron star will turn into a black hole</p></div>

    <p><h1 class='long-text'>Spaghettification</h1></p>
    <p >Spaghettification is the stretching of an object vertically as it enters a black hole, it occurs quicker in black holes with smaller solar masses, such as 1 solar mass. This is caused by the rapid increase in gravity between the event horizon and singularity. After an object passes the event horizon all laws of physics break down, and therefore time is irregular and cannot be measured accurately.   </p></div>

    <p><h1>What happens if you fall into a black hole?</h1></p>
<p>From the research that we have done we have completed. We have found that if you falled into a black hole you would certainly die. Although the time taken for this would vary depending on the type of black hole. For large black holes such as Saggitarius A* (4.154 million solar masses) it would take around 16 seconds for you to die after you crossed the event horizon due to the increased distance from the ringularity (as it is a spinning black hole). Although on a black hole with 1 solar mass you would die almost instantly due to the short distance required for you to travel between the event horizon and the singularity </p>
